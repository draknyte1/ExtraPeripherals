README
====================================

####What all this things are.

This is my attempt at remaking MiscPeripherals. It will also include things I want like RF chargers.

####Credits
Most images come from the original MiscPeripherals mod, so you feel like you are playing 1.6 again.
Things like the mouse are from me.

####Copyrights
You can do whatever you want except:
- Redistribute this.
- Claim it as your own mod and put it on your website. (Unless I let you.)
- Put it on your website and put "Eyeballcode" or "Edward Yeung" as the author.
- Say I copied textures. RichardG releases the code and textures, and I am just porting it to 1.7.10.
- You can use bits and pieces of code as ideas, but no copying

####Modpacks
- You can put it in a modpack, I don't care.
- Just put a link to this page.
- An email or comment telling me you put it in your modpack would be nice.

####Pull Requests
- Make sure your fork is updated, as I might be updating it EVERY NIGHT! <--YEAH, look here.

####You can
